Oswaldo Felix graduated from Harvard University (2019) with a BA in Environmental Science and Public Policy. His coursework, emphasizing energy resource management, strengthened his beliefs that system optimization is important to both our environmental and economic futures. Oswaldoâ€™s capstone project, advised by Professors Daniel P. Schrag and John H. Shaw, discussed nuclear waste management calling attention to a neglected system that leaves dangerous waste uncontained. Oswaldo is completing his master's degree in environmental management at UCSB's Bren School. There he has become a founding member of the eco-entrepreneurship venture, Unicado, where his group is developing a business model that incentizes the removal of damaging purple urchin species. Through the upcyling of agricultural food waste, the project is able to enhance the marketable qualities of purple sea urchins and capitalize on the local high demand. He is certain that by improving his business acumen Oswaldo will be able to make the most impact with his passion and ability for optimization. Ultimately, Oswaldo is seeking to implement efficient solutions that will transition the energy grid away from fossil fuels.
