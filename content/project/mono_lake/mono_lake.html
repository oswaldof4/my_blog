<p>This finalized graph shows the change in Mono Lake’s water levels over time. Sections of the graph are shaded to highlight important historical changes in Mono Lake’s water usage. The LA Aqueduct was completed in 1913 and after fully acquiring rights to the Mono Lake Basin water it began diverting water from the lake’s source rivers in 1941. Water levels bounce back after Mono Lake Tufa State Reserve is created. Mandates stablished in 1994 require the lake to maintain an average water level of 6392 ft indicated on the graph by the dotted red line. When water levels are low enough land bridges appear that allow animals in otherwise separate habitats to interact.</p>
