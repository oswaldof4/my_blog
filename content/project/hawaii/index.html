<p>The Hawaiian Islands are home to a variety of different habitats. The big island is known to have 8 out of the 13 different climate zones. Making sure that anthropogenic land use is not adversely affecting the diverse landscape is important. This project seeks to visualize spatial data to observe overlap of land usage and important watersheds of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>

<p>In this map, the white lines represent the extent of watersheds. Observing the north end of the island there is a concentration of agricultural land, but also defined very small watershed areas. These relatively small watershed areas could allow for easier runoff mitigation as accountability is not as diffuse if there was instead one large watershed. The color palette accentuates urban or built up land highlighting where city development has concentrated on the coast. Many of the small red spots scattered on the island are from industrial power plants. The watershed lines converge at the top of each of the two volcanoes. Mauna Kea is the barren land spot in the northern section of the island, while Mauna Loa is the barren spot in the southern section. Another interesting effect is the order in which land use areas appear as one moves away from the center of the volcanoes. Next to barren land thereâ€™s a high chance for rangle land to appear, followed by forests, and then agricultural land.</p>
